# Plan
- Sir to setup the environment and get the tutorial working
- You follow the guide and get the tutorial working.
- You find other videos of other similar situations and test if the prototype works.
- Customize the prototype/script to do other things, like check images.
- Create a prototype that given a video feed (for now you can use your webcam), if a fire is detected than an email is sent or some other alarm.
